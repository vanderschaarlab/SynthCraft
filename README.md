# <img src="docs/assets/climb-logo-no-text.png" height=25> CliMB-DC

This repository contains **CliMB-DC**, a Data-Centric copilot system that builds upon the [CliMB](https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/climb) ecosystem.

## üì¶ Installation: CliMB-DC
The installation process is analogous to the original CliMB system, with the only difference being in the [üìà Install the CliMB package step](https://climb-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#install-the-climb-package). You should replace the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/climb.git
```
with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DrShushen/climb-dc.git
```

## üöÄ Usage: CliMB-DC

In order to run CliMB-DC, you can follow the original [CliMB quickstart guide](https://climb-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) but choose the *engine* (in the *Research Management* page, *Select engine* dropdown) to be:
```
openai_dc
```
or
```
azure_openai_dc
```
depending on the OpenAI model provider you are using.

## üìÉ Note on Licensing

The code inside [`impl_agpl` directory](./src/climb/tool/impl_agpl) is only compatible with the [AGPL-3.0 license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/).

It is not compatible with the [Apache-2.0 license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/), under which the core of the project (CliMB-DC **core**) is licensed.

If you wish to use the extra tools provided in the `impl_agpl` directory, you must explicitly install the `[extra]` version of CliMB-DC like so:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/climb.git
cd climb
pip install -e climb[extra]
```

If you are forking/deriving from the code that **requires the tools in the `impl_agpl` directory** (i.e. CliMB-DC with `[extra]`), you **must** also license your code under the AGPL-3.0 license.

**Note:**

The code of CliMB-DC **core** does not depend on the code in the `impl_agpl` directory or its functionality. The `[extra]` version is *completely isolated and optional*.
Hence the core of CliMB-DC can be used under the Apache-2.0 license while the tools in the `impl_agpl` directory can be used *only* under the AGPL-3.0 license.

## üè• Overview
CliMB is an AI-enabled partner designed to empower clinician scientists to create predictive models from real-world clinical data, all within a single conversation. With its no-code, natural language interface, CliMB guides you through the entire data science pipeline, from data exploration and engineering to model building and interpretation. The intuitive interface combines an interactive chat with a dashboard that displays project progress, data transformations, and visualizations, making it easy to follow along. Leveraging state-of-the-art methods in AutoML, data-centric AI, and interpretability tools, CliMB offers a streamlined solution for developing robust, clinically relevant predictive models.

Our vision is for CliMB to integrate seamlessly into the clinician's workflow, supporting the complete cycle of clinical predictive modeling, and ultimately democratizing machine learning and AI utilization in healthcare.

:class: attention

It is crucial to understand the data privacy and confidentiality implications of using CliMB. Please ensure to read and understand the [Data Privacy documentation section](dataprivacy.md) in full prior to installing and using the system.
```
include_docs_end -->

When using CliMB with real-world clinical data, you as the clinician scientist act as the data steward, and are responsible for ensuring that the use of the data complies with all the relevant laws and regulations, as well as ethical considerations. CliMB aims to provide a secure and privacy-preserving environment for data exploration and model building, while balancing this with leveraging the capabilities of the most advanced large language models (LLMs).

We provide a detailed section in the documentation, which summarizes the data privacy fundamentals of CliMB and should allow you to make an informed decision about using the system with your data. It is essential that you read and understand this prior to using CliMB, please find the link below:
